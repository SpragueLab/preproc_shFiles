# preproc_shFiles
Prisma preprocessing (AFNI)

NOTE: at present, this is full of old files that are no longer used. NYU Prisma users should look at spatial_afni_proc.sh (dirty right now, will clean soon) and bias_correct.sh. If surface smoothing/processing is important, also look at surfsmooth_mb_tst.sh (will also be updated soon)

Some functions (surface-->volume) require repository https://github.com/tommysprague/preproc_mFiles, which requires vistasoft (ideally this branch: https://github.com/tommysprague/vistasoft_ts/tree/sprague_gridfit_updates)
